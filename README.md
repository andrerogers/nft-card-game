# Project Heaven & Earth

In ancient time, people worshiped the elements, there were 2 major religions, they went by A, B, C & D.

A enjoyed the earth and fire, and relished in the heat. They lived by volcanoes and ash, they worshipped the elements off Lava & Earth.

B enjoyed the water and the cold. Lived in the frigid and the desolate, their days and nights bring them closer to the tide. 

Many years would pass, C, the youth impatient, with naturalists, elemental fanatics and religious heathens. They looked to the skies, and worshipped the heavens, where thunder and lighting turned the skies asunder.

D, the people who lurked outside the realm, where the old gods stood high on their perch watching, waiting, inciting the begotten and inducting the forgotten. They revel in the undead and curse the lands. They lie, quiet, dormant, waiting.....
